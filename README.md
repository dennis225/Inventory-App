# Inventory-App
Designed and created the structure of a Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about the product and allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

# Goals:
.Storing information in a SQLite database
.Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
.Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
